Fanby Game is a very "gentle" collection of mini-games.  

It never lets you lose, and it won't keep you up until dawn.  
Every time you open it, it randomly drops a little game for you—  
simple to play, soothing visuals, and levels that take just 30–90 seconds to clear.  
That tiny "click" moment when you succeed feels like eating a piece of candy, stretching after sitting too long, or sipping a cool glass of water.  

Perfect for those little moments:  

- Stealing 10 seconds of calm before a meeting  
- On the subway when you don't want to doomscroll videos  
- When anxiety creeps in and you just need to empty your mind  
- Before bed when you refuse to grind or stress about anything  

It doesn't cure anything, but it's really, really good at comforting you.  

Fanby Game – Your pocket-sized gentle escape.
